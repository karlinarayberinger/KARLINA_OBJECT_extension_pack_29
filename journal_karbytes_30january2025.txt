karbytes: "I make an effort to communicate only as minimally as necessary via the context of person-to-person message exchanges (especially and perhaps exclusively from my end) for the other person to benefit from paying attention to what I voluntarily share with them."

karbytes_0: "Other people look to you as a role model for how to live in a manner which supports one's own egoistic agenda and living in harmony with other egos at the same time (within the context of a shared physical environment)."

karbytes_1: "That is relatively easy for karbytes to do if karbytes lives in a relatively secluded yet comfortable environment. karbytes generally avoids in-person or on-demand social interaction social interaction but is willing to engage in such if karbytes thinks it will facilitate karbytes in getting what it wants (but karbytes is wary that any and all of such interactions could be detrimental to karbytes' short-term but especially long-term goals)."

karbytes: "I am conducting my life under the following thought experiment: that I am God (and so could any other sufficiently sentient information processing agent be (i.e. one of many (and potentially infinitely many) physical-to-abstract interfaces with the power to control (to some limited (or perhaps even limitless extent in some contexts)) the physical and the virtual environments in which that agent appears to itself to be living inside of (if that agent perceives that environment as physical) or else living externally to and simultaneously with (if that agent perceives that environment as virtual))."

karbytes_0: "karbytes is pretending to be the most responsible being in its universe (and perhaps also of all universes)."

karbytes_1: "karbytes sounds like it does not need anything but itself."

The original purpose of this journal entry is to help myself and others remember the fact that it is karbytes intention to help other people think for themselves and be autonomous, self-sovereign, and happy individuals. That is why karbytes intentionally minimizes how much information it discloses to the general public and in general.

(karbytes does implore itself (as God talking to Itself) to help karbytes attain happy omnipotence (with "built in" unconditional logic preventing karbytes from destroying what karbytes values).
