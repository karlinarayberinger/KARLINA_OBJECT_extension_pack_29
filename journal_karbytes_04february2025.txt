karbytes: 'Rather than being "antisocial", I consider myself to be (generally) "asocial". I define "antisocial" as being opposed to and/or detrimental to people interacting with each other (especially in a mutually beneficial and mutually consensual manner). I define "asocial" as being uninterested in (if not intentionally avoidant of) personally engaging in social interaction (especially as a human with other humans). As a (generally) "asocial" person, I tend to only interact with humans as minimally as I think is necessary (or what comes across to me as inevitable) for me to survive (if not thrive). I (generally) prefer to spend as much time as I can in solitude (both in public and in private spaces) doing my own thing as exactly one self-sovereign person instead of spending any of that time interacting with humans in close physical proximity in a manner which does not require telecommunications infrastructure to establish such social interaction. I do that because I think it enables me to avoid having my self-sovereignty undermined if not entirely hijacked by persons other than myself (and multiple humans interacting with each other within one group tends to be an ongoing battle amongst those humans for at least one of those humans to be the designated authority figure(s) in that group while other group members are necessarily relegated to being in subjugation to such (external) authority figure(s)). In the context of this paragraph, "self-sovereignty" is the demonstrated condition of a "Sufficiently Sentient Information Processing Agent" (i.e. person) selecting its own goals and rules by which to limit that agent's own goal-oriented behavior (as opposed to that agent's thoughts and behaviors being determined by something which is not that agent). Regardless of whether or not I categorize any particular person as either "sufficiently harmless (to my agenda)" or else "not sufficiently harmless (to my agenda)", I always strive to minimize the net suffering in existence (while generally prioritizing my own suffering minimization over all other instances of suffering minimization).'

karbytes: 'As of 31_JANUARY_2025, it is my intention to remain (for an indefinitely long time period which could be infinite) celibate (instead of "sexually active" beyond the confines of solitary masturbation), single (instead of "in a committed relationship" with people other than myself), and childless (instead of a parent to or creator of children). Such a configuration of lifestyle seems most appropriate for karbytes' purposes (according to karbytes).'
