karbytes: 'I have an idea (which seems more surrealist than hypothetical): that consciousness is an emergent property which literally takes the form of a computational process runtime instance occurring within (and as a result of) some other computational process (and that such processes fundamentally amount to converting between (relatively adjacent)  "layers" (such that one of those two "layers" is relatively abstract while the other "layer" in that pair is relatively concrete (and such alternating between adjacent "layers" causes energy to be expended and hence matter to change until that energy is zero (and then the "container" (of all those recursively nested process "layers") is "born")).'
