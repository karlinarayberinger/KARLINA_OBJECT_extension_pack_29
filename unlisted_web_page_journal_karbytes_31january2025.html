<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I noticed a few errors in files which are part of the (now finalized) section of my blog named <strong>raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28</strong>.</p>
<p>(The name in the previous sentence refers to a specific &#8220;micro directory&#8221; within the &#8220;macro directory&#8221; of the website named Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com).</p>
<p>(The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to that micro directory&#8217;s top-level directory web page is as follows: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28/</a> ).</p>
<p>As per the requirements specified in the document named <strong>a_karbytes_content_management_policy</strong> (at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/a_karbytes_content_management_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/a_karbytes_content_management_policy/</a> ), it is (almost always) forbidden to alter karbytes content after that content&#8217;s respective &#8220;micro directory&#8221; (i.e. which is eventually referenced on the web page named <strong>RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY</strong> at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/</a> ) has been burned to M_DISCs by its author (i.e. karbytes). </p>
<p>The only times alterations to so-called &#8220;finalized&#8221; content within the websites named <strong><u>Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</u></strong> (whose top-level directory web page is located at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a> ) and <strong><u>Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</u></strong> (whose top-level directory web page is located at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/</a> ) are ever permitted is when karbytes decides that such alterations are necessary for maintaining the &#8220;structural integrity&#8221; of the public-web-hosted (and public domain) collection of (all connected via hyperlinks into one cohesive and entirely traversible via merely clicking on hyperlinks within the two aforementioned websites) named karbytes.</p>
<p>(Within the context of the aforementioned file collection, <strong>karbytes</strong> is the name of that file collection and, also, the name of that collection&#8217;s sole author. Elaboration on what is meant by the term karbytes is available on the web page at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a> ).</p>
<p>As always, karbytes strives to minimize (if not completely avoid) making errors in the files which comprise the (non-finalized) current and (noumenal (relative to the (human-to-cyborg) author of the aforementioned file collection named karbytes)) future &#8220;micro directories&#8221; of the aforementioned &#8220;macro directory&#8221;. </p>
<p>karbytes hopes to make zero errors in the &#8220;micro directory&#8221; of karbytes named <strong>raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29</strong>.</p>
<p>(The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to that micro directory&#8217;s top-level directory web page is as follows: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/</a> ).</p>
<p>Finally, karbytes (accidentally) specified in the web page named <strong>mdisc_karbytes2025_2</strong> (which is located at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_2/</a> ) that raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28 would be open to further changes after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_FEBRUARY_2025. Before karbytes burned the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_2 to M_DISCs (and hence finalized that version), karbytes intended to finalize that version as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_FEBRUARY_2025. In reality, that version (i.e. karbytes2025_2) was finalized as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 26_JANUARY_2025. </p>
<p>(This file (whose essential content is contained inside of the plain-text file named <strong>journal_karbytes_31january2025.txt</strong> and which is located at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/main/journal_karbytes_31january2025.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/main/journal_karbytes_31january2025.txt</a> ) is part of the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_3 and is expected by karbytes to be finalized within the next three months (which is approximately 90 days) after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 28_JANUARY_2025 according to the document named <strong>preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_28january2025</strong> (which is located at the following URL: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_28january2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_28january2025/</a> )).</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
