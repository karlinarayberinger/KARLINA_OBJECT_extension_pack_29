To Whom It May Concern:

I noticed a few errors in files which are part of the (now finalized) section of my blog named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28.

(The name in the previous sentence refers to a specific "micro directory" within the "macro directory" of the website named Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com).

(The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to that micro directory's top-level directory web page is as follows: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28/ ).

As per the requirements specified in the document named a_karbytes_content_management_policy (at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/a_karbytes_content_management_policy/ ), it is (almost always) forbidden to alter karbytes content after that content's respective "micro directory" (i.e. which is eventually referenced on the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/ ) has been burned to M_DISCs by its author (i.e. karbytes). 

The only times alterations to so-called "finalized" content within the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (whose top-level directory web page is located at the following URL: https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ ) and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (whose top-level directory web page is located at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/ ) are ever permitted is when karbytes decides that such alterations are necessary for maintaining the "structural integrity" of the public-web-hosted (and public domain) collection of (all connected via hyperlinks into one cohesive and entirely traversible via merely clicking on hyperlinks within the two aforementioned websites) named karbytes.

(Within the context of the aforementioned file collection, karbytes is the name of that file collection and, also, the name of that collection's sole author. Elaboration on what is meant by the term karbytes is available on the web page at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/ ).

As always, karbytes strives to minimize (if not completely avoid) making errors in the files which comprise the (non-finalized) current and (noumenal (relative to the (human-to-cyborg) author of the aforementioned file collection named karbytes)) future "micro directories" of the aforementioned "macro directory". 

karbytes hopes to make zero errors in the "micro directory" of karbytes named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29.

(The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to that micro directory's top-level directory web page is as follows: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/ ).

Finally, karbytes (accidentally) specified in the web page named mdisc_karbytes2025_2 (which is located at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_2/ ) that raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_28 would be open to further changes after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_FEBRUARY_2025. Before karbytes burned the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_2 to M_DISCs (and hence finalized that version), karbytes intended to finalize that version as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_FEBRUARY_2025. In reality, that version (i.e. karbytes2025_2) was finalized as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 26_JANUARY_2025. 

(This file (whose essential content is contained inside of the plain-text file named journal_karbytes_31january2025.txt and which is located at the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_29/main/journal_karbytes_31january2025.txt ) is part of the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_3 and is expected by karbytes to be finalized within the next three months (which is approximately 90 days) after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 28_JANUARY_2025 according to the document named x (which is located at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_28january2025/ )).

Sincerely,
karbytes
